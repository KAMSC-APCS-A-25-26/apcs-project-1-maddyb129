A text-based adventure/fantasy game where you go on a journey to find the evil wizard domain,
where your cat, Rocky, is being held captive. You get new items, meet new companions,
and encounter different challenges along the way. Remember, your choices matter.
The map consists of locations like the player's village, the mountains,
a small town, and the wizard's domain. This game contains very mild violence.
